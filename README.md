# 2d-physics-engine
A simple (in progress) physics engine built with raylib and C++, which I (re)started this August. 

**Some of the learning goals for this project are to:**
- **Cleanly** scale my own C++ application through things like generic and extensible programming, as well as modular, clean, and portable code.
- Create impressive physics simulations by solving real performance problems and pushing my hardware. This involves cache awareness, careful multithreading, C++ language knowledge, and optimizations supported by precise benchmarking and profiling.
- Practice managing project lifetimes and staying on track with proper prioritization via kanban boards.
- Continuously apply concepts I've learned in internships and school to something that I am especially passionate about and is unique to my interests, and just have fun coding.

### Currently: 
I've been busy with school and being a SWE intern, but I've finished a decent physics solver that can handle around 2,750 dynamic rectangular objects in a scene. I'm moving to spatial partitioning soon to improve performance after taking care of a few QOL features around the engine to clean up the code and help me iterate faster.

Going to push some demo videos soon as well
